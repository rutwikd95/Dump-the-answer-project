# Dump-the-answer-project
This is the Dump The Answer game that I made as part of my Final Year project for Undergraduate degree. This repository includes the unity project files as well as the exported game executable. The game requires Leap Motion Controller installed and connected in-order to run and play.

Also requires Leap Motion Unity Asset Pack to be added to the project for Leap Motion gestures and other features.
